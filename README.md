## Introduction

<!-- begin docs -->

SharePoint is a platform developed by Microsoft that serves as a central hub for collaboration, document management, and content sharing within organizations. It allows users to create, store, and access documents, as well as collaborate on projects in a secure and organized online environment.

## Before setting up

Before you can connect you need to make sure that:

- You have a Microsoft 365 account.
- You have a [SharePoint site created](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/create-a-site-in-sharepoint-4d1e11bf-8ddc-499d-b889-2b48d10b1ce8).

### How to find site name

You can find site name:

- On SharePoint start page.
![Start page](image/README/sharepoint-start-page.png)

- By clicking on _My sites_ tab.
![My sites](image/README/my-sites.png)

From there, you can view your sites and choose the one you want to work with.

## Connecting

1. Navigate to apps and search for Microsoft SharePoint. If you cannot find Microsoft SharePoint then click _Add App_ in the top right corner, select Microsoft SharePoint and add the app to your Blackbird environment.
2. Click _Add Connection_.
3. Name your connection for future reference e.g. 'My organization'.
4. Fill in the display name of your site e.g. 'My communication site'. 
5. Click _Authorize connection_.
6. Follow the instructions that Microsoft gives you, authorizing Blackbird.io to act on your behalf.
7. When you return to Blackbird, confirm that the connection has appeared and the status is _Connected_.

Note: if you have just created a site, you should wait a couple of minutes before trying to connect.

## Actions

### Documents

- **Get file metadata** retrieves the metadata for a file from site documents.
- **List changed files** returns a list of all files that have been created or modified during past hours. If number of hours is not specified, files changed during past 24 hours are listed.
- **Download file**.
- **Upload file to folder**.
- **Delete file**.
- **Get folder metadata** retrieves the metadata for a folder.
- **List files in folder** retrieves metadata for files contained in a folder.
- **Create folder in parent folder**.
- **Delete folder**.

## Events

- **On files updated or created** is triggered when files are updated or created.
- **On folders updated or created** is triggered when folders are updated or created.
- **On pages created or updated** this polling event is triggered when pages are updated or created.
- **On pages deleted** this polling event is triggered when pages are deleted.

## Example
Example 1
![Example](image/README/example.png)

Here, whenever PDF files are uploaded to SharePoint Documents, each file is downloaded, translated with Language Weaver and placed in the appropriate directory based on the translation quality assessment.

Example 2
![Example](image/README/example2.png)
In this example, the workflow starts with the **On pages created or updated**. Then, the workflow uses the **Get page as HTML** action to get html content of updated/created page. In the next step we translate this content via DeepL and then send the translated page to Slack channel.
## Missing features

In the future we can add actions for lists. Let us know if you're interested!
